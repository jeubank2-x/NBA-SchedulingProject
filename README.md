# NBA Schedule Analysis Project

This project explores how professional basketball team schedules influence performance using R.  
It analyzes schedule congestion (such as 4-in-6 stretches), travel patterns, and home/away balance across multiple seasons, 
and builds a logistic regression model to estimate how schedule factors impact win probability.

All data and results are anonymized for demonstration purposes.
 

## Tools & Libraries
- R, Tidyverse, ggplot2, plotly  
- Logistic Regression (glm) for modeling  
- Data visualization and schedule feature engineering

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `project.Rmd` in RStudio  
3. Knit to **HTML** or **Word** output  

## Summary of Findings
- The frequency of back-to-back games has declined significantly over the last decade  
- Long road trips (3+ games) remain stable, balancing travel efficiency  
- Home-court advantage is the most significant predictor of win probability  
- Back-to-back games slightly reduce win odds, while “4-in-6” congestion has minimal impact
